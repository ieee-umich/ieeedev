					<h4>History of the Bagel Stand </h4>

				</div>
				<div class="col s12">
					<p style="font-size:130%;">
						Short on funds but wanting to provide more services to their members, IEEE and ACM decided that selling bagels in the EECS atrium would be a great way to raise money. So, on September 20, 1993, the Bagel Stand was opened in the EECS atrium, and has been providing excellent service since then.
						<br><br>
						In 2007, HKN merged their pizza and donut stand with IEEE’s bagel stand to form the dB Cafe. In January 2008, the stand moved into its current location in the EECS atrium.
						<br><br>
						Today, the dB Café still sells bagels and now maintains a great variety of foods and drinks. Stop by and see us or see the menu below.
